            <h1>About In2It</h1>

            <p>The In2It team is an interdisciplinary group of tech-oriented Chicagoans who think that civic involvement matters. A survey of our fellow Chicagoans found that there is a sizeable group that wants to be civically engaged, but faces obstacles to doing so. We want to make it easier for people to get involved in their communities.</p>

            <p>This website is a work in progress, if you would like to get involved, we meet weekly at ChiHackNight. You can learn more about ChiHackNight and register for the next event at <a href="https://chihacknight.org/" target="_blank">chihacknight.org</a></p>
